 * Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
 * n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i are at (i, ai) and (i, 0).
 * Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis, form a container such that the container contains the most water.
 *
 * Notice that you may not slant the container.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
 * Output: 49
 * Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7].
 *              In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: height = [1,1]
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
 * Output: 16
 *
 * Example 4:
 * Input: height = [1,2,1]
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Constraints:
 * n == height.length
 * 2 <= n <= 10^5
 * 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4

     * Approach: Two Pointer Technique
     *
     * Why Two Pointers?
     * A brute-force approach involves checking all pairs of lines, which results in O(nÂ²) time complexity.
     * Two pointers reduce the time complexity to O(n) by efficiently narrowing down the search space.
     *
     * Algorithm:
     * 1. Initialize Pointers: Place one pointer at the left end (`left`) and the other at the right end (`right`) of the array.
     * 2. Compute Area: The amount of water the container can hold is determined by the shorter line among the two pointers,
     *    multiplied by the distance between them:
     *    area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
     * 3. Move the Pointer:
     *    Since the water is limited by the shorter line, move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward to potentially
     *    find a taller line and maximize the area.
     * 4. Repeat Until the Pointers Meet: Keep track of the maximum area seen so far.
