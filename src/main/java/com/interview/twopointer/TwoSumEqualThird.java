/*
 * Given an array of distinct integers. The task is to count all the triplets such that sum of two elements equals the third element.
 * https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-the-triplets4615/1
 * Category: Must Do
 * Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 2}
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 triplets: 
1 + 2 = 3 and 3 +2 = 5 
√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄπExample 2:

Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {2, 3, 4}
Output: 0
Explanation: No such triplet exits
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countTriplet() which takes the array arr[] and N as inputs and returns the triplet count

Expected Time Complexity: O(N2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 103
1 ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ 105

    Approach 2: Using Hashing
To improve efficiency, use a hash set to check if the sum of any two elements exists as a third element in the array.

Store All Elements in a Set: By storing all elements in a set, we can quickly check if the sum of two numbers exists in the array.
Iterate Through Pairs: For each pair (arr[i], arr[j]), check if arr[i] + arr[j] exists in the set.
This approach reduces the time complexity to
ùëÇ
(
ùëõ
2
)
O(n
2
 ) on average.
 Explanation of the Hashing Solution
HashSet for Lookup: Adding elements to a HashSet allows
ùëÇ
(
1
)
O(1) average time complexity for lookup.
Counting Valid Triplets: For each pair (i, j), if the sum exists in the set, we increment the count.
This method efficiently finds the number of valid triplets with a time complexity of
ùëÇ
(
ùëõ
2
)
O(n
2
 ) and a space complexity of
ùëÇ
(

O(n).

    /*
        To optimize this problem, we use a sorting and two-pointer approach.
        By leveraging the sorted order of the array, we can reduce the time complexity to O(n^2),
        eliminating the need for additional space.

        Optimized Approach: Sorting with Two-Pointer Technique

        1. Sort the Array:
           - Start by sorting the array to ensure elements are in ascending order.

        2. Iterate with Two Pointers:
           - For each element arr[i], treat it as the target sum (i.e., arr[i] = arr[j] + arr[k]).
           - Use two pointers:
               - Set `j` (left pointer) to the beginning of the array.
               - Set `k` (right pointer) to `i - 1`, just before the current element.

        3. Two-Pointer Sum Check:
           - If arr[j] + arr[k] equals arr[i], a valid triplet is found. Increment `count` and move both pointers inward.
           - If the sum is less than arr[i], increment `j` to increase the sum.
           - If the sum is greater than arr[i], decrement `k` to decrease the sum.

        4. Repeat the process for each possible i value until all potential triplets are checked.
