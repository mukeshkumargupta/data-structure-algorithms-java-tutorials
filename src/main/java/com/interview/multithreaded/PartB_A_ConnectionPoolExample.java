/*
    ðŸ“Œ Explanation of the Code
    ðŸ”¹ 1. ConnectionPool Class
    Uses a BlockingQueue (LinkedBlockingQueue) to manage connections.
    Initializes a fixed pool size and pre-fills it with connections.
    Implements getConnection() to acquire a connection.
    Implements releaseConnection() to return the connection back to the pool.
    Provides a shutdown() method to gracefully close all connections.
    ðŸ”¹ 2. Multi-threaded Testing (Main Class)
    Creates a ConnectionPool with a size of 5.
    Spawns 10 threads to acquire and release connections.
    Ensures proper thread synchronization.
    Calls shutdown() after all threads complete execution.
    âœ… Why This Implementation?
    âœ” Efficient & Scalable: Uses a queue-based approach to manage connections.
    âœ” Thread-safe: Uses synchronized methods to prevent race conditions.
    âœ” Graceful shutdown: Ensures all connections are closed properly.
