These probabilistic data structures are popular in distributed systems design interviews for positions at Facebook and other tech giants.
They are useful in scenarios where space and time efficiency is paramount, and where exact answers can be relaxed for approximate solutions.
Knowing how to implement these structures, their applications, and trade-offs is crucial in system design interviews.

1. HyperLogLog
   Question: Design a system to count the unique number of visitors to a website (or unique elements in a large dataset) in a memory-efficient way.

2. MinHash
   Question: How would you detect near-duplicate documents or content across multiple sources using minimal space?

3. Count Sketch
   Question: Design a system to identify the most frequent elements in a stream of data, such as the most popular search terms or most visited URLs.

4. Top-K Heavy Hitters using Count-Min Sketch + Heap
   Question: How would you find the top-K most frequent items in a stream of data?

5. SimHash
   Question: How would you detect near-duplicate images or text in a large dataset using a space-efficient method?

6. Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLT)
   Question: Design a system for detecting and correcting differences between two large datasets in a space-efficient way.

7. Skip Lists
   Question: How would you design a data structure that allows for efficient insertions, deletions, and lookups with probabilistic guarantees?

8. T-Digest
   Question: How would you efficiently estimate percentiles or quantiles in a large data stream with limited memory?
