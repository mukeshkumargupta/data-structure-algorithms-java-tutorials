        üß† Skiplist Concept Summary
        A Skiplist is a layered, probabilistic data structure that improves search, insert, and delete
        operations over a standard linked list by maintaining multiple levels of forward pointers
        that allow for fast traversal (like express lanes in a highway).

        Structure:
        - The bottom level is a fully connected sorted singly linked list.
        - Each higher level skips over elements to speed up access.
        - The head node has pointers for all levels.
        - Nodes are promoted to higher levels with 50% probability
          (or configurable via PROMOTION_PROBABILITY).

        üìò Methods Explained

        1. search(int target)
           - Starts from the highest level and scans right until it can‚Äôt go further without overshooting target.
           - Drops down one level and repeats.
           - Ends on level 0 where it checks for equality.
           - ‚úÖ Returns true if found, false otherwise.

        2. add(int num)
           - Similar traversal to search but records the last position visited on each level in an update[] array.
           - Randomly generates the new node's level (higher with smaller probability).
           - Inserts the new node by adjusting pointers at each applicable level.

        3. erase(int num)
           - Again, traverses the skiplist while storing previous nodes on each level.
           - If num exists on level 0, removes the node by bypassing it on all levels.
           - Also trims unused top levels to keep the skiplist compact.

        ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity

        Operation    | Average Time | Worst Time | Reason
        -------------------------------------------------------------
        Search       | O(log n)     | O(n)       | Level traversal and node skipping
        Add          | O(log n)     | O(n)       | Depends on level height and insertion
        Erase        | O(log n)     | O(n)       | Similar to search + pointer updates

        - In practice, operations are logarithmic thanks to the random distribution of node heights
          (expected height: O(log n)).

        üßÆ Space Complexity
        - Each node has up to log n forward pointers (levels).
        - The total number of forward pointers across the skiplist is O(n) on average.
        - The update[] array used in add and erase methods is of fixed size MAX_LEVEL, so it contributes O(1).

        ‚úÖ Overall Space Complexity: O(n)

        üîç Use Case Summary
        - Efficient alternative to balanced binary search trees (like AVL or Red-Black Trees).
        - Useful in concurrent systems or for indexing, caches, and approximate data structures.
