 *
 * Designing an Online Stock Brokerage System involves creating a comprehensive framework
 * that allows users to trade stocks, manage portfolios, and access market data. Hereâ€™s a
 * low-level design outline that captures key components, interactions, and system functionalities.
 *
 * Low-Level Design for Online Stock Brokerage System
 *
 * 1. Key Components
 *    - User Management:
 *      - Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
 *      - Ensures secure management of user data and sessions.
 *
 *    - Market Data Management:
 *      - Provides real-time market data including stock prices, trends, and volumes.
 *      - Fetches data from external financial market APIs.
 *
 *    - Order Management:
 *      - Manages the creation, updating, and cancellation of stock orders.
 *      - Supports different types of orders: market, limit, stop-loss, etc.
 *
 *    - Portfolio Management:
 *      - Keeps track of user-owned stocks and their current values.
 *      - Provides insights on portfolio performance and analytics.
 *
 *    - Trading Engine:
 *      - Processes buy and sell orders and matches them with available offers.
 *      - Implements trading rules and regulations.
 *
 *    - Payment Gateway Integration:
 *      - Processes deposits, withdrawals, and fee payments securely.
 *      - Manages payment details and transaction histories.
 *
 *    - Notifications and Alerts:
 *      - Sends real-time notifications to users about order statuses, market changes, and price alerts.
 *
 * 2. Core Requirements
 *    - User Registration and Authentication:
 *      - Support user registration, login, password reset, and multi-factor authentication.
 *
 *    - Order Processing:
 *      - Handle various types of orders with appropriate validations and rules.
 *
 *    - Data Persistence:
 *      - Use a database for storing user data, order histories, and market data.
 *
 *    - Performance Monitoring:
 *      - Monitor system performance metrics and logs for troubleshooting.
 *
 *    - Scalability:
 *      - Design the system to handle a growing number of users and transactions efficiently.
 *
 *    - Security:
 *      - Implement encryption for sensitive data, secure API access, and input validation.
 *
 * 3. Class Design
 *
 * 4. System Architecture
 *    - Frontend: Web or mobile interface for user interactions.
 *    - Backend: RESTful API to handle requests and responses.
 *    - Database: SQL or NoSQL database for data storage.
 *    - External APIs: Integrate with stock market data providers for real-time data.
 *    - Message Queue: For processing asynchronous tasks (e.g., order execution, notifications).
 *
 * 5. Scalability Considerations
 *    - Microservices Architecture: Each component (e.g., user management, order processing)
 *      can be developed as a separate service.
 *    - Load Balancing: Distribute traffic across multiple instances of services.
 *    - Database Sharding: Scale database horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers.
 *
 * 6. Security Considerations
 *    - Data Encryption: Secure sensitive user data and communication channels.
 *    - Authentication: Use OAuth2 or JWT for secure API access.
 *    - Input Validation: Prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
 *
 * 7. Monitoring and Logging
 *    - Performance Metrics: Track system performance (response times, order processing times).
 *    - Error Tracking: Implement logging mechanisms for troubleshooting.
 *
 * Conclusion
 * This low-level design for an Online Stock Brokerage System provides a structured
 * approach to building a robust platform that supports stock trading, user management,
 * and market data handling. The design can be expanded further to include additional
 * features like analytics, social trading, or advanced trading tools.
