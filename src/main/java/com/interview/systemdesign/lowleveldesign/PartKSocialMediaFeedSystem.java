/*
 * Hereâ€™s a complete solution for designing a Social Media Feed system using object-oriented principles in Java.
 * This implementation includes classes for User, Post, Feed, and Follow, providing the functionality to post content,
 * follow/unfollow users, and view the feed in reverse chronological order.
 *
 * Explanation of the Code:
 *
 * User Class:
 * - Represents a user in the system who can post content and follow/unfollow other users.
 *
 * Post Class:
 * - Represents a post made by a user, with attributes like content, timestamp, and the user who posted it.
 *
 * Feed Class:
 * - Manages the feed for a user, fetching posts from the people the user follows in reverse chronological order.
 *
 * Follow Class:
 * - Manages the follow relationships between users, allowing users to follow and unfollow each other.
 *
 * SocialMediaFeedSystem Class:
 * - Coordinates the system, handles users, posts, and follows, and displays the feed for each user.
 *
 * Key Considerations:
 *
 * Efficient Querying:
 * - In a real-world system with millions of users, retrieving posts efficiently is crucial.
 *   Techniques like pagination (loading posts in chunks) and caching (storing frequently requested data in memory)
 *   would improve scalability.
 *
 * Scalability:
 * - As the system grows, sharding (distributing data across servers), load balancing, and using distributed databases
 *   like Cassandra can be used to handle large-scale traffic.
 *
 * Reverse Chronological Order:
 * - Posts from followed users are sorted based on their timestamp, ensuring that the most recent posts appear first.
 *
 * Follow/Unfollow:
 * - Users can follow or unfollow other users dynamically. This can be expanded to include notifications when new posts
 *   are made by followed users.
 *
 * Real-Time Updates:
 * - For a fully-fledged system, you would need real-time data synchronization (e.g., WebSockets) to update the feed
 *   when new posts are made by followed users.
 *
 * Extensions and Enhancements:
 *
 * User Authentication:
 * - Adding login/signup functionality with authentication tokens.
 *
 * Comment and Like System:
 * - Allow users to comment on and like posts.
 *
 * Recommendation Algorithm:
 * - Suggest users to follow based on interests or connections.
 *
 * Notifications:
 * - Notify users when someone they follow posts something.
 *
 * This solution provides a strong foundation for a social media feed system and can be further enhanced with
 * more complex features as needed.
