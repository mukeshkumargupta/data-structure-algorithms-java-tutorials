Binary Search Trees (BST) have several recurring problem patterns that commonly appear in coding interviews. Below is a structured breakdown of BST problem patterns along with some example problems.

1. Basic Operations
   These problems involve fundamental BST operations like insertion, deletion, and search.

   ✅ Common Problems:
   - Insert into a BST (Leetcode #701)
   - Delete Node in a BST (Leetcode #450)
   - Search in a BST (Leetcode #700)

2. Inorder Traversal Properties (Sorted Order)
   Since an inorder traversal of a BST gives a sorted order, these problems leverage that property.

   ✅ Common Problems:
   - Kth Smallest Element in a BST (Leetcode #230)
   - Convert BST to Sorted Doubly Linked List (Leetcode #426)
   - Validate BST (Leetcode #98)

3. Range Queries
   BSTs allow efficient range-based queries by pruning branches early.

   ✅ Common Problems:
   - Range Sum of BST (Leetcode #938)
   - Count Nodes in a Range (variation of range sum)
   - Trim a BST (Leetcode #669)

4. Successor & Predecessor in BST
   These problems focus on finding the next or previous element in sorted order.

   ✅ Common Problems:
   - Inorder Successor in BST (Leetcode #285)
   - Inorder Predecessor in BST (variation of successor)

5. Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
   Since BSTs follow an order, LCA problems can be solved efficiently by traversing based on value comparison.

   ✅ Common Problems:
   - Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST (Leetcode #235)
   - Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree (Leetcode #236) → For general trees.

6. BST Construction & Modification
   These problems involve constructing or modifying BSTs.

   ✅ Common Problems:
   - Construct BST from Preorder Traversal (Leetcode #1008)
   - Convert Sorted Array to BST (Leetcode #108)

7. BST & Tree to Graph Conversion
   Some problems involve flattening a BST or modifying its structure.

   ✅ Common Problems:
   - Binary Tree to BST Conversion (GFG Problem)
   - Flatten BST to a Sorted List (variation)

8. Balanced BST Transformations
   BST balancing problems involve constructing or rebalancing a BST to ensure optimal height.

   ✅ Common Problems:
   - Convert Sorted List to BST (Leetcode #109) [already done under BST construction]
   - Balance a BST (Leetcode #1382)

9. Merge and Split BST
   These problems involve merging or splitting BSTs into multiple valid BSTs.

   ✅ Common Problems:
   - Merge Two BSTs (Leetcode #1214) Hard Not understood
   - Split BST (Leetcode #776) Premium

10. BST & Graph-Like Problems
    Some problems combine BST properties with graphs, often leading to tree traversal + graph concepts.

    ✅ Common Problems:
    - BST Iterator (Inorder Traversal using Stack) (Leetcode #173)
    - Recover Binary Search Tree (Leetcode #99)

| BST Construction             | Construct BST from Preorder             |
| Tree to Graph Conversion     | Binary Tree to BST                      |
| Balancing BSTs               | Balance a BST, Convert Sorted List to BST |
| Merging & Splitting BSTs     | Merge Two BSTs, Split BST               |
| BST & Graph Mix              | BST Iterator, Recover BST               |

Final Thoughts:
---------------
If you're preparing for BST-related problems, focus on:
- BST Traversal techniques (Inorder, Preorder)
- Insert/Search/Delete operations
- Utilizing BST properties (sorted order, efficient range queries)
- Handling edge cases (skewed trees, duplicate values, NULL nodes)
