 * Problem Description:
 * Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
 *
 * - Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 * - Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 * - Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
 *
 * Note:
 * - A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
 * - Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: board =
 * [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
 * ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
 * ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
 * ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
 * ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
 * ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
 * ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
 * ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
 * ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
 * Output: true
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: board =
 * [["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
 * ,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
 * ,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
 * ,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
 * ,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
 * ,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
 * ,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
 * ,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
 * ,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The 5 in the top left corner is modified to 8, causing two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, making it invalid.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - board.length == 9
 * - board[i].length == 9
 * - board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.
