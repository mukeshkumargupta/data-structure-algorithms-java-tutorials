Given an m x n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.



Example 1:


Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]
Example 2:


Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
Output: []


Constraints:

m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 12
board[i][j] is a lowercase English letter.
1 <= words.length <= 3 * 104
1 <= words[i].length <= 10
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
All the strings of words are unique.

public class WordSearchII {
    /*
        ðŸ‘‡ Key Variables:
        W = number of words in the list
        L = average length of a word
        M = number of rows in the board
        N = number of columns in the board
        K = total number of characters across all words (â‰ˆ W * L)

        ðŸ§  Time Complexity

        ðŸ”¹ 1. Building the Trie (insert() method)
           For each word of length L, you traverse its characters and insert into the trie.
           Cost per word = O(L)
           Total = O(W * L)
           âœ… So, building the trie takes O(W * L) time

        ðŸ”¹ 2. DFS Traversal on the Board
           We do DFS starting from each cell in the MxN board.

           For each cell:
           In the worst case, the DFS can go up to the length of the longest word, which is L.
           But thanks to the Trie pruning, DFS does not explore unnecessary paths â€” it stops early if there's no valid child in the trie.

           So the DFS from one cell takes O(4^L) in the worst case without pruning,
           but with pruning it's much faster and bound by the total number of characters in all the words and the shape of the board.

           But to stay conservative in worst-case analysis, we still express it as:
           âœ… DFS per cell: O(4^L)
           âœ… Total DFS over the board: O(M * N * 4^L)

           But this is amortized down to:
           âœ… O(M * N * L) in practice due to the Trie early exits.

        âœ… Total Time Complexity:
           O(W * L)               â†’ building the Trie
         + O(M * N * L)           â†’ DFS with Trie pruning
         = O(W * L + M * N * L)

        ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity

        ðŸ”¹ 1. Trie Space
           Each word of length L adds nodes to the trie â€” up to 26 possible children per node, but we only insert actual characters.
           âœ… So, Trie space is: O(W * L)

        ðŸ”¹ 2. DFS Recursion Stack
           The depth of the recursion stack = length of the longest word = L.
           âœ… So, recursion stack uses: O(L)

        ðŸ”¹ 3. Result List
           Worst case: all words are found.
           âœ… So result list space = O(W)

        âœ… Total Space Complexity:
           O(W * L)         â†’ Trie
         + O(L)             â†’ DFS recursion
         + O(W)             â†’ Result list
         = O(W * L)
           (The O(L) and O(W) are small compared to O(W * L))

        âœ… Final Answer:
        Time Complexity: O(W * L + M * N * L)
        Space Complexity: O(W * L)
