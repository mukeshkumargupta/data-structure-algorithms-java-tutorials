Great twist to the original problem!

You're referring to a variation of the Combinations problem where:

Instead of a number n, you are given an array of integers (possibly with duplicates).

You want to generate all unique combinations of size k.

‚úÖ Problem:
Given an array int[] nums that may contain duplicates, return all unique combinations of length k.

üîç Key Differences from Original:
We must skip duplicate combinations.

To handle duplicates, we sort the array and skip adjacent duplicates during backtracking.



Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n].

You may return the answer in any order.



Example 1:

Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
Explanation: There are 4 choose 2 = 6 total combinations.
Note that combinations are unordered, i.e., [1,2] and [2,1] are considered to be the same combination.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: [[1]]
Explanation: There is 1 choose 1 = 1 total combination.


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 20
1 <= k <= n

     ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity

     Step-by-step Analysis:

     1. Number of combinations:
        We're generating all combinations of k out of n.
        This is:
            C = (n choose k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
        Let‚Äôs call this value C.

        üëâ So we will make C recursive calls that reach the base case and add a list to the result.

     2. Time per combination:
        Each combination has k elements.
        Creating a new ArrayList<>(current) takes O(k) time.

     ‚úÖ Total Time Complexity:
        Total Time = O(C √ó k) = O((n choose k) √ó k)

        For example, if n = 20 and k = 10,
        then C = 184,756, and each combination takes O(10) time.

     üì¶ Space Complexity

     Let‚Äôs analyze both explicit (in-memory) and implicit (call stack) space usage:

     1. Recursive Call Stack:
        In the worst case, the recursion goes k levels deep
        (since we add one number at a time until the size is k).

        üëâ So the maximum depth of recursion = k
        Stack space = O(k)

     2. Current List (`current`):
        At any time, we store up to k elements in the current list
        because we're building combinations of size k.

        So this also costs O(k) space.

     3. Result List:
        We are storing all combinations in the result list.
        Each combination has size k, and there are C = (n choose k) such combinations.

        So the total result size is:
            O(C √ó k) = O((n choose k) √ó k)

     ‚úÖ Total Space Complexity:
        O(k) (call stack + current list) + O((n choose k) √ó k) (result list)

        We usually report total space complexity as:
            O((n choose k) √ó k)
        since the result list dominates the memory usage.

     üöÄ Summary

     | Complexity Type | Value                                 |
     |------------------|----------------------------------------|
     | Time Complexity  | O(C √ó k) where C = (n choose k)        |
     | Space Complexity | O(C √ó k) for result + O(k) auxiliary   |
