 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.

        while (start <= end) {
          //System.out.println(start + ", " + end); 
          int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (mid ==0 &&  nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]) {
                return mid; 
            } else if (mid == nums.length -1 && nums[mid] > nums[mid-1]) {
                return mid;
            }
          else if (mid-1 >= 0 && mid+1 <nums.length && nums[mid] > nums[mid+1] && nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] ) return mid;
          else if (mid-1 >= 0 && nums[mid-1] > nums[mid]) end = mid - 1; //if mid is less than previous then potential candidate is first half
          else start = mid + 1;
        }
        return -1;
