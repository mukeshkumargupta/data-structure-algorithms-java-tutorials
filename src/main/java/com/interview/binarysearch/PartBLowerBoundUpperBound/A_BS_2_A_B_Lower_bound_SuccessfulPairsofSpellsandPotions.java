2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions
Medium
Topics
Companies
Hint
You are given two positive integer arrays spells and potions, of length n and m respectively, where spells[i] represents the strength of the ith spell and potions[j] represents the strength of the jth potion.

You are also given an integer success. A spell and potion pair is considered successful if the product of their strengths is at least success.

Return an integer array pairs of length n where pairs[i] is the number of potions that will form a successful pair with the ith spell.



Example 1:

Input: spells = [5,1,3], potions = [1,2,3,4,5], success = 7
Output: [4,0,3]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 5 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [5,10,15,20,25]. 4 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [1,2,3,4,5]. 0 pairs are successful.
- 2nd spell: 3 * [1,2,3,4,5] = [3,6,9,12,15]. 3 pairs are successful.
Thus, [4,0,3] is returned.
Example 2:

Input: spells = [3,1,2], potions = [8,5,8], success = 16
Output: [2,0,2]
Explanation:
- 0th spell: 3 * [8,5,8] = [24,15,24]. 2 pairs are successful.
- 1st spell: 1 * [8,5,8] = [8,5,8]. 0 pairs are successful.
- 2nd spell: 2 * [8,5,8] = [16,10,16]. 2 pairs are successful.
Thus, [2,0,2] is returned.


Constraints:

n == spells.length
m == potions.length
1 <= n, m <= 105
1 <= spells[i], potions[i] <= 105
1 <= success <= 1010

        ðŸ’¡ Intuition:
        The brute force approach would be to try every spell-potion pair which is O(n * m) â€” too slow for large inputs.

        Instead, we sort potions[] and for each spell, binary search the smallest potion that satisfies spell * potion >= success.

        From that index onward, all potions will form successful pairs with this spell.

        âœ… Approach:
        Sort potions[].

        For each spell, calculate the minimum potion value required:
        minPotion = ceil(success / spell)

        Use binary search on potions[] to find the first index where potion â‰¥ minPotion.

        All potions from that index to end are valid.

        ðŸ§  Why binary search works:
        Since potions are sorted, the condition spell * potion >= success turns into finding the first potion such that potion >= success / spell.

        Once we find that point, the number of valid potions is potions.length - index.

        ðŸ§® Time Complexity:
        Operation                         Time
        Sorting potions                   O(m log m)
        Binary search for n spells       O(n log m)
        Total                            O(m log m + n log m)
        Where:
        n = spells.length
        m = potions.length

        ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity:
        O(1) extra space (excluding result array and sorting input)
