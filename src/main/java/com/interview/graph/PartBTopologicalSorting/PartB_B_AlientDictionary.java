/*
 * üõ∏ Problem: Alien Dictionary
 *
 * You are given a list of words from an alien language, where the words are sorted
 * lexicographically *according to the rules of this alien language*. The alien language
 * uses the same lowercase Latin characters ('a' to 'z'), but the order among the characters
 * is *unknown* to you.
 *
 * üîç Goal:
 * Your task is to **determine a valid order of characters** in the alien language based on the
 * given sorted word list.
 *
 * üîß Assumptions:
 * - The given list of words is already sorted as per the alien dictionary's order.
 * - The alien dictionary may have multiple valid character orderings.
 * - If it‚Äôs impossible to determine the order (e.g., due to a cycle), return an empty string.
 * - All letters in the alien language are lowercase Latin letters, but not all letters
 *   are guaranteed to appear in the input.
 *
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases:
 * - If two adjacent words are in the wrong order (e.g., "abc" and "ab"), it‚Äôs invalid.
 * - If a cycle is detected in the character dependency graph, a valid order is impossible.
 *
 * üß† Key Idea:
 * - The task reduces to **topological sorting** of a graph where each node is a character.
 * - We create directed edges between characters where the first difference in adjacent words
 *   implies character precedence.
 *
 * üß± Example:
 * Input: words = ["wrt", "wrf", "er", "ett", "rftt"]
 * Output: "wertf" (or another valid topological sort)
 * Explanation:
 * From "wrt" and "wrf", we know 't' comes before 'f'.
 * From "wrf" and "er", we know 'w' comes before 'e'.
 * From "er" and "ett", we know 'r' comes before 't'.
 * From "ett" and "rftt", we know 'e' comes before 'r'.
 * Combining these relations and topologically sorting them gives the answer.

    /*
     * Explanation:
     *
     * 1. Graph Construction:
     *    - We build a directed graph where each node is a character in the alien language.
     *    - By comparing adjacent words, we find the first differing character to establish
     *      a directed edge from the character in the first word to the character in the second word.
     *    - This represents the precedence (order) relationship between characters.
     *
     * 2. DFS Cycle Detection and Topological Sort:
     *    - We use DFS to traverse nodes and detect cycles.
     *    - Each node has three states: unvisited (0), visiting (in recursion stack), and visited.
     *    - If we reach a node already in the recursion stack, it means a cycle exists, so the order is invalid.
     *    - When DFS finishes exploring a node‚Äôs neighbors, we push it onto a stack.
     *    - The final topological order is the reverse of the stack (pop all elements).
     *
     * 3. BFS (Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm) for Topological Sort:
     *    - We compute the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each node.
     *    - Initialize a queue with all nodes having in-degree 0 (no dependencies).
     *    - Repeatedly dequeue a node, add it to the result, and reduce in-degree of its neighbors.
     *    - If neighbors‚Äô in-degree becomes zero, add them to the queue.
     *    - If we process all nodes, we get a valid topological order.
     *    - If some nodes remain unprocessed (due to cycles), return invalid.
     *
     * 4. Edge Cases:
     *    - If word2 is a prefix of word1 and appears after it, no valid order exists.
     *    - Cycles in graph make it impossible to derive a valid order.
     *
     * --------------------------------------------
     * Time Complexity:
     *
     * Let:
     *  - N = number of words
     *  - L = average length of each word
     *  - C = number of unique characters in all words (‚â§ 26)
     *
     * Graph Construction:
     *  - Compare adjacent pairs: O(N * L)
     *  - Each comparison at most L characters until difference found
     *
     * DFS Approach:
     *  - Building graph: O(N * L)
     *  - DFS visits each node once, and edges once: O(C + E)
     *  - In worst case, E (edges) ‚â§ C¬≤ (if fully connected)
     *  - Overall: O(N * L + C + E)
     *
     * BFS Approach:
     *  - Same graph construction: O(N * L)
     *  - BFS topological sort: O(C + E)
     *  - Overall: O(N * L + C + E)
     *
     * Since C ‚â§ 26 (letters a-z), C and E are small constants for most cases, so dominant cost is O(N * L).
     *
     * --------------------------------------------
     * Space Complexity:
     *
     * - Adjacency list: O(C + E)
     * - visited, recursion stack or in-degree maps: O(C)
     * - Stack or queue for topo order: O(C)
     * - Result string: O(C)
     *
     * Since C ‚â§ 26, space is effectively constant relative to input size,
     * but considering input characters, space is O(C + E).
