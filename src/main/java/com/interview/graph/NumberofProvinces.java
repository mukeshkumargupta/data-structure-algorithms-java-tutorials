     Explanation of Changes
    1D visited Array:

    The problem only requires checking if a city (i) has been visited, so a 1D array suffices.
    DFS on the Adjacency Matrix:

    Instead of grid-like traversal, iterate over all neighbors (neighbor) of the current city (city) using the adjacency matrix (isConnected[city][neighbor]).
    Province Counting:

    For each unvisited city (i), increment the province count and explore all cities connected to it using DFS.
    Time and Space Complexity
    Time Complexity:
    O(nÂ²) because we iterate over all entries in the isConnected adjacency matrix.
    Space Complexity:
    O(n) for the visited array and recursion stack during DFS.
    Example
    Input:

    plaintext
    Copy
    Edit
    isConnected = [
        [1, 1, 0],
        [1, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 1]
    ]
    Output:

    plaintext
    Copy
    Edit
    2
    Explanation:

    Cities 0 and 1 form one province.
    City 2 is isolated and forms another province.
    This solution works as expected for the problem. Let me know if you'd like further clarification!
