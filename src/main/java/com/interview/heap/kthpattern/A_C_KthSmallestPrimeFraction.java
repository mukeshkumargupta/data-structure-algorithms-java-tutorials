You are given a sorted integer array arr containing 1 and prime numbers, where all the integers of arr are unique. You are also given an integer k.

For every i and j where 0 <= i < j < arr.length, we consider the fraction arr[i] / arr[j].

Return the kth smallest fraction considered. Return your answer as an array of integers of size 2, where answer[0] == arr[i] and answer[1] == arr[j].



Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,5], k = 3
Output: [2,5]
Explanation: The fractions to be considered in sorted order are:
1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, and 2/3.
The third fraction is 2/5.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,7], k = 1
Output: [1,7]


Constraints:

2 <= arr.length <= 1000
1 <= arr[i] <= 3 * 104
arr[0] == 1
arr[i] is a prime number for i > 0.
All the numbers of arr are unique and sorted in strictly increasing order.
1 <= k <= arr.length * (arr.length - 1) / 2

        ‚úÖ Why Min Heap is Better for This Problem (K-th Smallest Prime Fraction):

        üåü 1. Natural Fit for Finding Smallest Elements
           - We're trying to find the K-th smallest fraction.
           - Min Heap keeps the smallest element at the top, making it efficient to fetch the next smallest pair.

        üìà 2. Controlled Growth
           - We don't generate all possible fractions (which would be O(n¬≤)).
           - Instead, we:
             a. Start with the smallest possible values.
             b. Progress in a greedy and incremental manner by moving to the next smallest fraction with the same numerator
                or decrementing the denominator.

        üîÅ 3. Efficient Iteration
           - We only process at most K fractions, keeping heap operations efficient at O(log k).

        ‚ùå Why Max Heap Is Not a Good Fit Here:
           - Max Heap is used when we want to keep track of the top K largest elements,
             or want to discard the largest while retaining smaller ones.
           - In this problem, you don‚Äôt know all the candidate fractions up front (we're generating them on-the-fly).
           - Max Heap would require:
             a. Generating all O(n¬≤) fractions.
             b. Storing at most K in the heap and comparing each.
           - This would become similar to brute force + heap ‚Äî not optimal.

        ‚öñÔ∏è Summary:

        | Criteria        | Min Heap                              | Max Heap                                |
        |----------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
        | Suitability     | ‚úÖ Best fit for finding smallest values| ‚ùå Poor fit for incremental smallest search|
        | Heap Operations | Efficient (Push/Pop smallest)         | Inefficient unless you precompute all    |
        | Time Complexity | O(k log n)                            | O(n¬≤ log k)                              |
        | Space Efficiency| O(n) heap                             | O(k) heap but more input to scan         |

        üß† Verdict:
        ‚úÖ Use Min Heap for this problem.
        It‚Äôs clean, efficient, and tailored to the nature of the problem.

        ----------------------------------------------------------

        üë§ You said:
        > i think you are telling wrong ‚Äî for getting k-th largest element we use minHeap and k-th smallest we use max heap, am i correct?

        üß† ChatGPT said:
        > You're absolutely right in general ‚Äî and your understanding is solid!
        > Heap choice may differ depending on the problem structure ‚Äî especially in special cases like K-th Smallest Prime Fraction.

        ‚úÖ General Rule of Thumb:

        | Goal                 | Heap Type             | Why                                      |
        |----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
        | K-th largest element | Min Heap of size K     | Keep K largest seen so far; smallest at top |
        | K-th smallest element| Max Heap of size K     | Keep K smallest seen so far; largest at top |

        üîç Why the Min Heap Is Used in K-th Smallest Prime Fraction:
        - Instead of scanning all n¬≤ pairs, we use a greedy heap-based approach.
        - Each heap element is a pair (i, j) representing arr[i] / arr[j].
        - The heap explores the next smallest fraction on demand, like a 2D matrix traversal.

        | Problem Type                          | Heap Used             | Why                                           |
        |--------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
        | K-th largest (unsorted array)        | Min Heap (size K)      | Track top K largest seen so far               |
        | K-th smallest (unsorted array)       | Max Heap (size K)      | Track top K smallest seen so far              |
        | K-th smallest fraction (sorted array)| Min Heap (custom comp) | Efficiently explore next smallest fraction    |

        üß† TL;DR:
        ‚úÖ You're correct in general.
        üìå This problem is a special case ‚Äî and Min Heap is better due to the greedy, incremental structure of valid pairs.
