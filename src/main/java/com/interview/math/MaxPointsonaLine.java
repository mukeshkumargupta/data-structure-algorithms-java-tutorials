Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane, return the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.



Example 1:


Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 3
Example 2:


Input: points = [[1,1],[3,2],[5,3],[4,1],[2,3],[1,4]]
Output: 4


Constraints:

1 <= points.length <= 300
points[i].length == 2
-104 <= xi, yi <= 104
All the points are unique.

    üß† Brute Force Approach
        Idea:
        A line can be uniquely determined by two points.

        So, for every pair of points (i, j):

        Count how many other points lie on the same line as i and j.

        How to check if a point k lies on the line formed by i and j?

        Use cross multiplication to avoid floating point issues:

        Copy
        Edit
        (y2 - y1) * (x3 - x1) == (y3 - y1) * (x2 - x1)
    üìä Time and Space Complexity
        Time Complexity: O(n¬≥)

        For every pair (i, j) ‚Üí check all other k points.

        Space Complexity: O(1)

        No extra data structures used.

    Great! The problem ‚ÄúMax Points on a Line‚Äù is a classic geometry + hash map-based problem
    that revolves around slope calculation, collinearity, handling duplicates, and GCD simplification.

    Here are all the key concepts and potential variations/questions that can be derived from this topic:

    üîπ Core Concepts Involved:
    - Slope Calculation (dy/dx)
    - Collinearity Check (cross-multiplication trick)
    - HashMap usage for grouping
    - Handling vertical lines (dx = 0)
    - Handling duplicate points
    - GCD usage to normalize slopes
    - Line representation (point + slope, or Ax + By + C = 0)

    üìò Problems & Variations Derived From This Concept:

    1. Max Points on a Line (Classic - LeetCode 149)
       - Count the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.
       - Use slope hashing or brute force with collinearity check.

    2. Check if N points are collinear
       - Just return true/false.
       - Can be solved using slope comparison or cross multiplication.

    3. Count number of distinct lines passing through given points
       - Instead of max points on a line, count how many unique lines can be formed from pairs of points.

    4. Find all sets of collinear points (>= 3 points)
       - Return all sets of points that lie on the same line.
       - Similar to the max points on a line, but group and return all such lines.

    5. Minimum number of lines to cover all points
       - NP-hard variation; given a set of points, find the least number of lines
         such that all points are on at least one line.

    6. Find if any 3 points in the given list form a straight line
       - Early exit if any triplet forms a line (basic cross product check).

    7. Detect if multiple lines are parallel
       - Check if multiple pairs of points share the same slope ‚Üí indicates parallel lines.

    8. Check if all points lie on a vertical/horizontal line
       - Easy variation, just check if all x or all y coordinates are same.

    9. Group all points lying on the same line
       - Return a list of groups where each group represents a set of collinear points.

    ‚öôÔ∏è Interview Insight:
    - These problems test geometry understanding, hashing tricks, and handling edge cases
      like vertical lines and duplicates.
    - They're also great for practicing map usage, GCD simplification, and math precision.
