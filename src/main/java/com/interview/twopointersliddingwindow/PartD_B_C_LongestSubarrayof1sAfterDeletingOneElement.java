Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1's is [1,1,1,1,1].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: You must delete one element.


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

    ‚è± Time Complexity
    - We iterate through the array once ‚Üí O(n)
    - Sliding window expands and shrinks linearly

    ‚úÖ Final Time Complexity: O(n)

    üß† Space Complexity
    - We use only constant extra space

    ‚úÖ Final Space Complexity: O(1)

    üß™ Example Dry Run
    Input:
    nums = [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]

    Steps:

    right	nums[right]	zeroCount	left	maxLen	Window
    0	    1	            0	        0	    0	    [1]

    7	    1	            1	        3	    5	    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]

    Output: 5

    Explanation:
    We are allowed to delete one element (usually a zero),
    so the longest subarray of only 1s after deleting one element is of length 5.
    Example: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1] ‚Üí remove the 0 ‚Üí length = 5
*/

    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int zeroCount = 0;
        int maxLen = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            if (nums[right] == 0) zeroCount++;

            // shrink window until there's at most 1 zero
            while (zeroCount > 1) {
                if (nums[left] == 0) zeroCount--;
                left++;
            }

            // length of window minus one (for deleting one element)
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left);
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
