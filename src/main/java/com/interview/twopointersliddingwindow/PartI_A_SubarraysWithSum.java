 * Category: Medium
 * Given a binary array nums and an integer goal, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum goal.
 *
 * A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:
 * [1,0,1,0,1]
 * [1,0,1,0,1]
 * [1,0,1,0,1]
 * [1,0,1,0,1]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [0,0,0,0,0], goal = 0
 * Output: 15
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
 * nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
 * 0 <= goal <= nums.length

    1. Brute Force Approach
        Approach:
        Iterate over all possible subarrays using two nested loops.
        For each subarray, calculate the sum.
        If the sum of the subarray equals the goal, increment the count.
        Time Complexity:
        O(nÂ²), where n is the length of the array. This is because we are generating all subarrays and calculating their sum.
        Space Complexity:
        O(1), only using constant extra space for storing count and sum.

    3. Better Approach (Prefix Sum with HashMap)
    Approach:
    Use the prefix sum concept with a hashmap to store the frequency of prefix sums.
    Traverse through the array, and for each index i, calculate the prefix sum up to index i.
    The problem boils down to checking how many times prefixSum - goal has been encountered so far because if prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[j] == goal, then the sum of the subarray nums[j+1:i] is goal.
    Use a hashmap to efficiently store and retrieve the prefix sum frequencies.
    Time Complexity:
    O(n), where n is the length of the array. The array is traversed once, and hashmap operations (insert and lookup) are done in constant time.
    Space Complexity:
    O(n), for storing the prefix sums in the hashmap.

        4. Time Complexity:
    O(n): Both the left and right pointers traverse the array once, making the time complexity linear.
