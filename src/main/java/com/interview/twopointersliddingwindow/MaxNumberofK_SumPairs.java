You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

Agrahhya@123456


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
1 <= k <= 109

üîç Problem:
Find the maximum number of pairs in the array that sum up to a given value `k`.
Each element can be used at most once.

Approach:
- Use a HashMap to track frequency of elements.
- For each number `num`, check if `k - num` exists in the map.
- If it does, form a pair and reduce frequency of both.

‚è± Time Complexity: O(n)
We iterate over the array once.

üß† Space Complexity: O(n)
HashMap stores frequencies of at most n elements.

üß™ Input:
nums = [3, 1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 4], k = 6

‚úÖ Expected Output:
3 pairs:
(3, 3)
(2, 4)
(2, 4)
