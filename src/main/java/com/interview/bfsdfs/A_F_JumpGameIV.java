 * Problem:
 * Given an array of integers arr, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
 *
 * In one step you can jump from index i to:
 * - i + 1 (if i + 1 < arr.length)
 * - i - 1 (if i - 1 >= 0)
 * - any index j such that arr[i] == arr[j] and i != j
 *
 * Goal:
 * Return the minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array.
 *
 * Important Note:
 * - You cannot jump outside of the array boundaries.
 * - Related common interview twist: Sometimes, they ask minimum jumps to reach *any* given index, but here the target is specifically the **last index**.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: arr = [100, -23, -23, 404, 100, 23, 23, 23, 3, 404]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 *  - Jump 0 -> 4 (arr[0] == arr[4])
 *  - Jump 4 -> 3
 *  - Jump 3 -> 9
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: arr = [7]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 *  - Start index is already the last index. No jump needed.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: arr = [7,6,9,6,9,6,9,7]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 *  - Jump directly from index 0 -> 7 (arr[0] == arr[7]), last index reached.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * - -10^8 <= arr[i] <= 10^8

        Optimized BFS Approach
        Explanation:
        Since the problem asks for the minimum number of jumps, BFS is a natural fit. BFS explores level by level and guarantees the shortest path is found first.
        For each index, you can jump to:
        The previous index (i - 1).
        The next index (i + 1).
        All indices with the same value as arr[i].
        To optimize:
        Use a Map to group indices by their values. This allows you to jump to all indices with the same value efficiently.
        Once a value is processed, remove its indices from the map to avoid revisiting.

        You're correctâ€”DFS in its naive form often does not work properly for the "Jump Game IV" problem because it can revisit indices excessively or get stuck in recursion depth issues. Additionally, finding the minimum number of jumps is naturally a BFS-type problem since BFS explores all nodes at the current "level" before moving to the next, ensuring the shortest path is found.
