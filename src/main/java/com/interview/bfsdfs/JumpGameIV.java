 * Given an array of integers arr, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
 * Related question: It can asked min jump required to reach at given index, however in this question it is asked for last index

In one step you can jump from index i to index:

i + 1 where: i + 1 < arr.length.
i - 1 where: i - 1 >= 0.
j where: arr[i] == arr[j] and i != j.
Return the minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [100,-23,-23,404,100,23,23,23,3,404]
Output: 3
Explanation: You need three jumps from index 0 --> 4 --> 3 --> 9. Note that index 9 is the last index of the array.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [7]
Output: 0
Explanation: Start index is the last index. You do not need to jump.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [7,6,9,6,9,6,9,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can jump directly from index 0 to index 7 which is last index of the array.
 

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 104
-108 <= arr[i] <= 108

        Optimized BFS Approach
        Explanation:
        Since the problem asks for the minimum number of jumps, BFS is a natural fit. BFS explores level by level and guarantees the shortest path is found first.
        For each index, you can jump to:
        The previous index (i - 1).
        The next index (i + 1).
        All indices with the same value as arr[i].
        To optimize:
        Use a Map to group indices by their values. This allows you to jump to all indices with the same value efficiently.
        Once a value is processed, remove its indices from the map to avoid revisiting.

        You're correctâ€”DFS in its naive form often does not work properly for the "Jump Game IV" problem because it can revisit indices excessively or get stuck in recursion depth issues. Additionally, finding the minimum number of jumps is naturally a BFS-type problem since BFS explores all nodes at the current "level" before moving to the next, ensuring the shortest path is found.
