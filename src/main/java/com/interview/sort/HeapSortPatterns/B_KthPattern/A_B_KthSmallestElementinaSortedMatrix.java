Given an n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, return the kth smallest element in the matrix.

Note that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than O(n2).



Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
Output: 13
Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13
Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
Output: -5


Constraints:

n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length
1 <= n <= 300
-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109
All the rows and columns of matrix are guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order.
1 <= k <= n2


Follow up:

Could you solve the problem with a constant memory (i.e., O(1) memory complexity)?
Could you solve the problem in O(n) time complexity? The solution may be too advanced for an interview but you may find reading this paper fun.

Flatten the matrix into a single list.

‚úÖ Approach 2: Min Heap (Priority Queue)
üîπ Idea:
Use a min heap to always fetch the next smallest element.

Push the first element of each row into the heap.

Pop from the heap and push the next element in the same row.
‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
O(k log n) because we perform k pops from a heap of size at most n. becaue k time i need to pop and total elements are n

O(n) for the heap.

    ‚úÖ Approach 3: Binary Search (Optimal)
üîπ Idea:
Binary search the answer space between matrix[0][0] and matrix[n-1][n-1].

For each mid, count how many elements are <= mid using a smart pointer approach per row.
‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity:
O(n log(max - min)), where max and min are matrix bounds.

üì¶ Space Complexity:
O(1) (no extra space used beyond variables).
