Hint
Given a string s, rearrange the characters of s so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.

Return any possible rearrangement of s or return "" if not possible.



Example 1:

Input: s = "aab"
Output: "aba"
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaab"
Output: ""


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.

    1. **Brute Force Approach (Nested Loops)**

    **Approach**:
    - Generate all permutations of the string.
    - Check each permutation to see if any adjacent characters are the same.
    - Return the first valid permutation.

    ---

    **Time Complexity**:
    - **Time Complexity**: O(N!), because generating all permutations of a string of length N takes O(N!) time.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(N), for storing all permutations.

    ---

    **Dry Run**:

    For the input `"aaab"`, the brute force solution would:

    - **Generate all permutations**:
      - ["aaab", "aaba", "abaa", "baaa"]

    - **Check if any permutation has adjacent characters that are the same**:
      - In the case of `"aaab"`, adjacent 'a's are present, so it is not valid.
      - Continue checking all permutations until we find a valid one, if any.

    This method is simple but inefficient.

    Explanation:

    1. **Frequency Count**:
       - We first count the frequency of each character in the string.

    2. **Max-Heap**:
       - We use a max-heap (priority queue) to always pick the character with the highest frequency.

    3. **Greedy Construction**:
       - We greedily append two characters from the heap to the result string and update their frequencies.
       - We ensure no adjacent characters are the same.

    4. **Final Check**:
       - If the last character canâ€™t be placed without breaking the constraint, we return an empty string.

    Time Complexity:
    - **Time Complexity**: O(N log K), where `N` is the length of the string and `K` is the number of distinct characters (at most 26 for lowercase letters).
    - **Space Complexity**: O(K), for storing character frequencies.

    ### Dry Run of the Better Approach (Using HashMap and Priority Queue)

    **Input**: `"aabbbc"`

    ---

    **Step 1**: Count frequency of characters using a `HashMap`

    | Character | Frequency |
    |-----------|-----------|
    | 'a'       | 2         |
    | 'b'       | 3         |
    | 'c'       | 1         |

    ---

    **Step 2**: Add characters to the `PriorityQueue` (max-heap) based on frequency.

    After adding characters to the `PriorityQueue`, the characters are sorted by frequency:

    | Character | Frequency |
    |-----------|-----------|
    | 'b'       | 3         |
    | 'a'       | 2         |
    | 'c'       | 1         |

    Priority queue order: `['b', 'a', 'c']`

    ---

    **Step 3**: Build the result string by greedily selecting two characters at a time.

    **First Iteration**:
    - Poll `first = 'b'` (highest frequency) and `second = 'a'`.
    - Append them to the result: `"ba"`.
    - Decrease their frequencies:
      - `'b'` frequency becomes 2 (`'b'` is added back to the heap).
      - `'a'` frequency becomes 1 (`'a'` is added back to the heap).

    **Result so far**: `"ba"`

    | Character | Frequency |
    |-----------|-----------|
    | 'b'       | 2         |
    | 'a'       | 1         |
    | 'c'       | 1         |

    Priority queue order: `['b', 'a', 'c']`

    ---

    **Second Iteration**:
    - Poll `first = 'b'` (highest frequency) and `second = 'a'`.
    - Append them to the result: `"baba"`.
    - Decrease their frequencies:
      - `'b'` frequency becomes 1 (`'b'` is added back to the heap).
      - `'a'` frequency becomes 0 (it is not added back).

    **Result so far**: `"baba"`

    | Character | Frequency |
    |-----------|-----------|
    | 'b'       | 1         |
    | 'c'       | 1         |

    Priority queue order: `['b', 'c']`

    ---

    **Third Iteration**:
    - Poll `first = 'b'` (highest frequency) and `second = 'c'`.
    - Append them to the result: `"bababc"`.
    - Decrease their frequencies:
      - `'b'` frequency becomes 0 (it is not added back).
      - `'c'` frequency becomes 0 (it is not added back).

    **Result so far**: `"bababac"`

    ---

    ### Final Result: `"bababac"`

    Since the last character 'c' was added without violating any constraints, we return `"bababac"`, which is a valid rearranged string.

    /*
    Explanation:

    - We count the frequency of each character using an array of size 26 (since only lowercase English letters are involved).
    - We use a priority queue (max-heap) to always pick the character with the highest frequency.
    - We greedily construct the result string, making sure no two adjacent characters are the same.
    - If the remaining character can't be placed without violating the condition, we return an empty string.

    ---

    **Time Complexity**:
    - **Time Complexity**: O(N log 26), which simplifies to O(N), where N is the length of the string.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(1) since the array size is fixed at 26.

    ---

    **Comparison of Time Complexity**:

    | Approach        | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
    |-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
    | **Brute Force** | O(N!)           | O(N)             |
    | **Better Approach** | O(N log K)  | O(K)             |
    | **Optimal Approach** | O(N)       | O(1)             |

    ---

    The **Optimal Approach** is the most efficient, especially when the string has a large length, because it reduces the time complexity to linear O(N) and uses constant space O(1).
