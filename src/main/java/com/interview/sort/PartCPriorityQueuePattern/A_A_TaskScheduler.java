 *
 * Description:
 * Given an array of tasks where each character represents a different task, the CPU must execute them in any order.
 * Each task requires exactly one unit of time to complete.
 * The CPU can either execute a task or remain idle for a unit of time.
 *
 * A non-negative integer `n` represents the cooldown period between two identical tasks.
 * This means that there must be at least `n` units of time between two occurrences of the same task.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of time units required to complete all tasks.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is:
 * A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
 * There must be at least 2 units of time between any two identical tasks.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: Since `n = 0`, any permutation of the tasks will work, such as:
 * ["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
 * ["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
 * ["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
 * Output: 16
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is:
 * A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 <= tasks.length <= 10^4
 * - tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
 * - 0 <= n <= 100

     * Brute Force Approach (Simulation using Priority Queue/Sorting)
     *
     * Approach:
     * 1. Count the frequency of each task.
     * 2. Process tasks in descending order of frequency.
     * 3. Simulate the scheduling using a PriorityQueue (max-heap) or Sorting.
     * 4. Insert tasks into a queue with cooldown tracking.
     *
     * Steps:
     * - Create a frequency map of tasks.
     * - Push all tasks into a max heap.
     * - Pop the most frequent tasks and schedule them, keeping track of cooldown.
     * - If a task is still in cooldown, wait (idle) until it can be scheduled.
     * - Repeat until all tasks are scheduled.
     *
     * Time Complexity:
     * - Building frequency map: O(N)
     * - Sorting (Heap operations): O(N log N)
     * - Processing tasks: O(N)
     * - Overall: O(N log N) due to heap operations.
     *
     * Space Complexity:
     * - Heap storage: O(26) (since max 26 tasks)
     * - Auxiliary space (cooldown tracking): O(N)
     * - Worst-case: O(N)
     *
     * Dry Run of the Brute Force Approach (Using Priority Queue)
     *
     * Example 1:
     * Input: tasks = ["A", "A", "A", "B", "B", "B"], n = 2
     *
     * Step 1: Frequency Count
     * Task  Frequency
     * A     3
     * B     3
     *
     * Step 2: Use Max Heap (Priority Queue)
     * Max Heap: [3, 3]  // A and B, both with frequency 3
     *
     * Step 3: Scheduling (Cycle = n + 1 = 3 slots)
     * Cycle No.  Selected Tasks from Heap   Remaining Frequencies   Time
     * 1 (0-2)    A, B, Idle                 (A=2, B=2)             3
     * 2 (3-5)    A, B, Idle                 (A=1, B=1)             6
     * 3 (6-7)    A, B                        (A=0, B=0)             8
     *
     * Final Output:
     * Total intervals taken = 8
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: tasks = ["A", "A", "A", "B", "B"], n = 3
     *
     * Step 1: Frequency Count
     * Task  Frequency
     * A     3
     * B     2
     *
     * Step 2: Use Max Heap (Priority Queue)
     * Max Heap: [A:3, B:2]
     * Cycle length = n + 1 = 4 slots
     *
     * Step 3: Scheduling Execution (Cycle-based execution)
     * Cycle No.  Selected Tasks from Heap   Remaining Frequencies   Scheduled Tasks   Time
     * 1 (0-3)    A, B, Idle, Idle           (A=2, B=1)             A B _ _           4
     * 2 (4-7)    A, B, Idle, Idle           (A=1, B=0)             A B _ _ A B _ _   8
     * 3 (8)      A                           (A=0, B=0)             A B _ _ A B _ _ A 9
     *
     * Final Output:
     * Total time intervals taken = 9
     *
     * Final Observations:
     * - Every cycle consists of n+1 slots (tasks + idle).
     * - When tasks run out, we remove the idle slots.
     * - The total time required is calculated based on heap scheduling.
     *
     * Brute Force Complexity Recap:
     * - Time Complexity: O(N log N) due to heap operations.
     * - Space Complexity: O(N) due to task storage.

         Optimized Mathematical Approach (Greedy Formula-Based Solution)

    Key Observations:
    - The most frequent task determines the minimum execution time.
    - If there are `maxFreq` instances of the most frequent task, they must be spaced apart by `n` intervals.
    - The total minimum time is driven by the formula:

        (maxFreq - 1) Ã— (n + 1) + count of maxFreq tasks

    - If there are `maxFreq` "A"s, we place them first, leaving gaps for other tasks or idle slots.

    Time Complexity:
    - Frequency Calculation: O(N)
    - Sorting: O(26 log 26) = O(1)
    - Final Computation: O(1)
    - Overall: O(N)

    Space Complexity:
    - Only `int[26]` array: O(1)
