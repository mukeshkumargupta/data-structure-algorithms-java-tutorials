 * You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

Example 5:

Input: nums = [4,-2], k = 2
Output: [4]

    Let's start with the brute force approach to solve the "Sliding Window Maximum" problem, then build towards the optimized solution.

    Brute Force Approach
    In the brute force approach, we can slide the window across the array and find the maximum value within each window. This approach involves nested loops:

    Outer Loop: Slides the window from the beginning to the end of the array.
    Inner Loop: Finds the maximum value within the current window.
    Here‚Äôs the brute force code:

    Explanation of Brute Force Approach:
    Initialization:

    Create an array result to store the maximums.
    Loop through the array from the start to the point where a full window can still fit (n - k + 1).
    Find Maximum in Each Window:

    For each position of the window, find the maximum element by iterating through the window size k.
    Store the maximum in the result array.

    Building the Optimized Approach
    The brute force approach has a time complexity of
    ùëÇ
    (
    ùëõ
    √ó
    ùëò
    )
    O(n√ók), where
    ùëõ
    n is the length of the array and
    ùëò
    k is the window size. This is inefficient for large arrays.

    To optimize, we use a deque to keep track of the indices of useful elements within the current window:

    Deque: A double-ended queue to store indices. The indices in the deque are maintained in such a way that the corresponding values are in decreasing order.
    Sliding Window: As the window slides, maintain the deque and extract the maximum for the current window efficiently.
    Optimized Code Explanation:
    Here's the optimized code with detailed comments:

    Detailed Steps of Optimized Code:
    Initialization:

    list (deque) to store indices.
    result array to store maximums.
    First Window:

    For the first k elements, maintain the deque such that the largest element‚Äôs index is at the front.
    Remove indices of elements that are less than the current element from the back of the deque.
    Process the Rest of the Array:

    Slide the window one element at a time.
    Remove elements not in the current window from the front of the deque.
    Maintain the decreasing order in the deque by removing elements less than the current element from the back.
    Add the current element's index to the back of the deque.
    The maximum of the current window is at the front of the deque and is added to the result array.
    Return the Result: Finally, return the result array containing the maximums for each sliding window.

    This approach ensures each element is added and removed from the deque at most once, resulting in an efficient time complexity of
