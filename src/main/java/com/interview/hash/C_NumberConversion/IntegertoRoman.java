Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.
Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.



Example 1:

Input: num = 3749

Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"

Explanation:

3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places
Example 2:

Input: num = 58

Output: "LVIII"

Explanation:

50 = L
 8 = VIII
Example 3:

Input: num = 1994

Output: "MCMXCIV"

Explanation:

1000 = M
 900 = CM
  90 = XC
   4 = IV


Constraints:

1 <= num <= 3999

    🔁 Example Walkthrough
Say num = 58:

Start from M (1000) → skip (58 < 1000)

...

L = 50 → subtract → num = 8, append "L"

X = 10 → skip

V = 5 → subtract → num = 3, append "V"

I = 1 → subtract 3 times, append "III"

Result: LVIII

⏱️ Time Complexity
O(1) (constant time): The input number is ≤ 3999. The outer loop runs at most 13 times (number of symbols), and the inner loop does limited work.

So practically, this is constant time.

📦 Space Complexity
O(1): We're only using a fixed-size array and a StringBuilder with bounded output size (since max Roman numeral length is also limited).

    public String intToRoman(int num) {

        String[] notations = {"M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I"};
        int[] values =       {1000, 900, 500, 400, 100,  90,  50,  40,  10,   9,   5,   4,   1};

        for (int i = 0; num > 0; i++) {
            while (num >= values[i]) {
                roman.append(notations[i]);
