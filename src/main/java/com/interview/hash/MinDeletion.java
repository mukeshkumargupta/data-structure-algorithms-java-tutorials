 * A string s is called good if there are no two different characters in s that have the same frequency.

Given a string s, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make s good.

The frequency of a character in a string is the number of times it appears in the string.
* For example, in the string "aab", the frequency of 'a' is 2, while the frequency of 'b' is 1.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aab"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already good.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in the good string "aaabcc".
Another way it to delete one 'b' and one 'c' resulting in the good string "aaabbc".
Example 3:

Input: s = "ceabaacb"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in the good string "eabaab".
Note that we only care about characters that are still in the string at the end (i.e. frequency of 0 is ignored).

        üîπ Approach 1: Brute Force (Try All Possibilities)

        üöÄ Idea:
        - Count the frequency of each character.

        - Try reducing duplicate frequencies manually by iterating and decrementing.

        - Time Complexity: O(N log N) due to sorting.
        - Space Complexity: O(1) (only uses an array of size 26).
