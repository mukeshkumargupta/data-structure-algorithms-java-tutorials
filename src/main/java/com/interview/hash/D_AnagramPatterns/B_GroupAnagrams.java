 *
 * üìù Problem Statement:
 * Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
 *
 * An Anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word using all original letters exactly once.
 *
 * üß† Intuition:
 * All anagrams share the same character frequency. So, strings with identical character frequencies belong to the same group.
 *
 * ‚úÖ Constraints:
 * 1 <= strs.length <= 10^4
 * 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
 * strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * üß™ Example 1:
 * Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
 * Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
 *
 * üß™ Example 2:
 * Input: strs = [""]
 * Output: [[""]]
 *
 * üß™ Example 3:
 * Input: strs = ["a"]
 * Output: [["a"]]

     * Approach 1: Brute Force
     *
     * Steps:
     * - For each word, generate all possible anagram pairs by sorting each word and checking if it matches other words.
     * - Use a nested loop to compare each word with every other word in the list. Identify anagrams by comparing sorted versions of the words.
     *
     * Complexity Analysis:
     * - Time Complexity: O(N^2 * M log M), where N is the number of strings and M is the average length of the strings.
     *   This complexity arises because each word is compared with every other word, and each comparison involves sorting.
     * - Space Complexity: O(N * M), for storing the results and auxiliary data.
     *
     * Explanation:
     * - This approach is inefficient because it involves comparing each word with every other word in the list, leading to a high time complexity.
     * - As a result, it is impractical for large inputs due to the quadratic nature of the comparisons and the additional sorting overhead.

     * Approach 2: Improved Solution with HashMap and Sorted Strings as Keys
     *
     * Steps:
     * - Sort each word's characters and use the sorted word as a key in a hashmap.
     * - Group all strings with the same sorted characters under the same key.
     * - Return the grouped anagrams by converting the hashmap values to a list of lists.
     *
     * Complexity Analysis:
     * - Time Complexity: O(N * M log M), where N is the number of strings and M is the length of each string.
     *   Sorting each string takes O(M log M) time.
     * - Space Complexity: O(N * M), due to storing strings in the hashmap.
     *
     * Explanation:
     * - This approach is significantly faster than the brute force solution. Sorting each string and using it as a key
     *   enables effective grouping of anagrams. However, sorting each string incurs an O(M log M) cost, indicating that
     *   there is room for further optimization.
     *
     * Summary:
     * | Approach            | Time Complexity     | Space Complexity    | Notes                                      |
     * |---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
     * | Brute Force         | O(N^2 * M log M)    | O(N * M)            | Inefficient for large inputs.              |
     * | HashMap with Sort   | O(N * M log M)      | O(N * M)            | Sorting-based solution with moderate speed.|
     * | Frequency Count     | O(N * M)            | O(N * M)            | Most efficient for large inputs.           |
     *
     * - Using sorted strings as keys is a good balance between simplicity and efficiency, though there are faster methods.

    /*
     * Approach 3: Optimized Solution with Character Frequency Count as Keys
     *
     * Steps:
     * - Use a frequency count of characters to uniquely represent each anagram group.
     * - For each word, create a frequency count array of size 26 (one for each lowercase letter) and use it as a key.
     * - Convert this count array to a string (or another unique format) to serve as the key.
     * - Use a HashMap to group anagrams under the same key.
     *
     * Complexity Analysis:
     * - Time Complexity: O(N * M), where N is the number of strings and M is the maximum length of each string.
     *   This is because we are counting characters instead of sorting.
     * - Space Complexity: O(N * M), due to the space required for storing grouped anagrams.
     *
     * Explanation:
     * - By using a frequency count array as the key, this approach avoids the O(M log M) cost of sorting each string,
     *   making it optimal for large datasets.
