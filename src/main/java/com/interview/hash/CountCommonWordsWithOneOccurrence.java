 * Given two string arrays words1 and words2, return the number of strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.

 

Example 1:

Input: words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"], words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.
- "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.
Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.
Example 2:

Input: words1 = ["b","bb","bbb"], words2 = ["a","aa","aaa"]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.
Example 3:

Input: words1 = ["a","ab"], words2 = ["a","a","a","ab"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only string that appears exactly once in each of the two arrays is "ab".
 

Constraints:

1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 1000
1 <= words1[i].length, words2[j].length <= 30
words1[i] and words2[j] consists only of lowercase English letters.

        ðŸ”¹ Approach 1: Brute Force (Two Hash Maps)

        ðŸš€ Idea:
        - Use two separate hash maps to count occurrences of words in both arrays.
        - Iterate over words1 and check if the word appears exactly once in both maps.

        - Building Frequency Map: O(n + m)
        - Checking for Valid Words: O(n)

        - Space Complexity: O(n + m) (storing frequency maps)

/*
     ðŸ”¹ Optimized Approach (Using Single Hash Map)

ðŸš€ Idea
Instead of using two separate hash maps, we:

âœ… Use one map (`wordCount`) to track occurrences across both arrays.
âœ… Use another set (`uniqueWords`) to track words appearing only once in each array.
âœ… Iterate once to filter words that appear exactly once.

ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis
   - **Time Complexity:** O(n + m)
   - **Space Complexity:** O(n + m) (stores words)

ðŸ”¹ Summary

| Approach     | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Explanation |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Brute Force** | O(n + m) | O(n + m) | Uses two separate hash maps. |
| **Optimized**  | O(n + m) | O(n + m) | Uses a single map with special marking. |
