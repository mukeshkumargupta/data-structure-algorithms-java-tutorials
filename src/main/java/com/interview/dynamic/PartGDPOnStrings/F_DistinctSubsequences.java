    ðŸ“„ Problem:
    Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

    The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

    ðŸ“š Example 1:
    Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    There are 3 ways to generate "rabbit" from "rabbbit":
    1. rab_bbit
    2. rabb_bit
    3. rabb_bi_t

    ðŸ“š Example 2:
    Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
    Output: 5
    Explanation:
    There are 5 ways to generate "bag" from "babgbag".

    ðŸ”¥ Constraints:
    - 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000
    - s and t consist of English letters only.
