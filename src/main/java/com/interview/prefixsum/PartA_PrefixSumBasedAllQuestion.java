     * Key Concepts to Focus On:
     * Prefix Sum Array: Understand how to build and manipulate prefix sum arrays to efficiently compute sums of subarrays.
     * Hash Maps: Useful for storing and retrieving sums and frequencies of cumulative sums, especially in problems like Subarray Sum Equals K.
     * Sliding Window: Often combined with prefix sum to optimize problems where the window of elements needs to be expanded and contracted dynamically.
     * Range Queries: Learn how to handle range queries efficiently using prefix sum techniques in problems like Range Sum Query or Sum of Subarray Minimums.
     * Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm: Essential for solving Maximum Subarray Sum problems, which is a variation of prefix sum that maintains the cumulative sum dynamically.
     * By mastering these problems, you'll be well-prepared for tackling prefix sum-based questions in coding interviews, especially in top tech companies.
